# Version 1 Usage

All defined routes return a JSON object and no pages are served.<br />
All actions require the version (v1) and the rules version (current as of this writing is 20140301)

-----
### Rule

A single rule can be requested `/v1/20140301/rule/1-2-2`
```json
{
  "rules": [
             {
               "number": "1.2.2",
               "contents": "The track surface shall be clean, flat, and suitable for roller skating. Acceptable surfaces include polished or painted concrete, wood, or game court floors."
             }
           ]
}
```

A rule and all of its sub rules can be returned by using a wild card (\*) `/v1/20140301/rule/1-7-4*`
```json
{
  "rules": [
             {
               "number": "1.7.4",
               "contents": "Officials may call an Official Timeout at any point. This will stop the clock so that referees have time to review a call or adjust the number of skaters on the floor (see Section 1.9.2.2)."
             },
             {
               "number": "1.7.4.1",
               "contents": "If the Officials call a timeout during a jam in progress, the jam will end and a new jam will be run if there is time remaining on the official period clock (see Section 1.4.3 and Section 8.2.6.3)."
             }
           ]
}
```

Only the sub rules are returned if the wild card (\*) is placed immediately following a hyphen `/v1/20140301/rule/1-7-4-*`
```json
{
  "rules": [
             {
               "number": "1.7.4.1",
               "contents": "If the Officials call a timeout during a jam in progress, the jam will end and a new jam will be run if there is time remaining on the official period clock (see Section 1.4.3 and Section 8.2.6.3)."
             }
           ]
}
```

               "number": "1.7.1",

               "contents": "To take a timeout, the Captain or Designated Alternate will signal the Officials to request a timeout. Officials will signal for the clock to stop."
             },
             {
               "number": "1.7.3",
               "contents": "Teams may take timeouts only between jams."
